# My-Second-iOS-Application---Pink-Gaming-Zone
This is my second iOS Application which I've built using the programming language SwiftUI on the Xcode IDE on MacOS
The aim to built this application was first and foremost, learning the TabView element and secondly, how to improve designs and User Interface.
My first iOS Application can be seen at https://github.com/mustafah99/My-First-iOS-Application---SwiftUI-Pizza-App-/tree/main .

In this application I learned how to implement NavView and TabView in the same app and how to adjust the View to remain the same across iPhone and iPad devices.
